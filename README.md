I'm Kushal. My research focuses on improving the systematic generalization, oversight and understanding of the training processes of large language models. 

Previously, I worked on the [science of neural network training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03096) and on improving the Transformer architecture at [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/), and worked on RL at [Applied Compute](https://appliedcompute.com/) and [Prime Intellect](http://primeintellect.ai/).
