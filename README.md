I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**), an undergrad at [Stanford](https://cs.stanford.edu/) studying Computer Science. Previously, I worked on the [science of neural network training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03096) at [STAIR](https://stair.cs.stanford.edu/), [adversarial attacks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Le7fswY1lj) at [CAIS](https://safe.ai/), and now think about in-context learning & build new LM architectures at [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/).

Reach out if you'd like to chat about anything!
