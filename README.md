I'm Kushal (pronounced **/kʊʃəl/**), an undergrad at [Stanford](https://cs.stanford.edu/) studying Computer Science. Previously, I worked on the [science of neural network training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03096) at [STAIR](https://stair.cs.stanford.edu/), [adversarial attacks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Le7fswY1lj) at [CAIS](https://safe.ai/), and now think about in-context learning & build new LM architectures at [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/) and Prof. [Chris Potts](https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/).

In my spare time, I like to do [photography](https://kushalthaman.tumblr.com/), write literary non-fiction, read economic history, play tennis, and counter my perpetual [onism](https://www.thedictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/concept/onism) by hiking mountains.
